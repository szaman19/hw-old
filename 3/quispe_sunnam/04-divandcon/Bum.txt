Chances are you probably won't even read this but:
Sorry I accidently violated our most sacred class code. On Tuesday I got home from SING rehearsal at 9:30, and fell asleep while doing my homework and by the time I woke up, I had to get ready for school! I hadn't done ANY of my homework yet, but I couldn't be late for school or else I wouldn't be able to perform in SING. I know this is waaayyyyy past the due date but it's better than nothing :)

I'm not a bum, I swear
