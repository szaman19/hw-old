A more efficient way to search through a sorted array or ArrayList is to use a binary search by choosing the middle element in an array and comparing that to the item being searched for. We can then split the array into two halves and choose a half based on whether the middle element was greater than or less than the item being searched for. We then continue this split of the array into halves until we have an array of length 1 or we've found what we're looking for.
