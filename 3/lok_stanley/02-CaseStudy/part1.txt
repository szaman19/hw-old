Set 1:
Q1:
It does not always move to a new location.  If there is something ahead of it and blocks the path of the bug, it stops and rotates instead
Q2:
It moves in the direction that the bug is already facing in.
Q3:
It rotates clockwise by 45 degrees until it finds an empty path
Q4:
The bug leaves behind a flower that is originally the same color as the bug.  After some each tick passes, the color of the flower changes
until it reaches a certain point where it stays that dead looking color
Q5:
If the bug is facing the edge of the grid, then it can not move forward anymore causing it to rotate.  On the other hand if the bug
is not facing the edge, then it is just moving normally
Q6:
The rock acts like any other obstruction, it just causes the bug to turn.
Q7:
A flower does not move by itself
Q8:
It changes color after each and every tick.  After a certain amount, it no longer changes color as the flower is "dead"
Q9:
The rock does not move and has no other behavior
Q10:
Only one actor can be on a grid at the same time

When you use the method moveTo, you have to set the coordinates of where you want the bug to be. You can set
the integers of the bug wherever you want it to be in the grid world and the bug will move to that location
The direction of the bug is preserved.  Whenever, you want to move the bug out of the grid, an error occurs
and the stacktrace of the error is pop up and displayed
