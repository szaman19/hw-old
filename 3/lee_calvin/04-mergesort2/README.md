MergeSort now has both the old assignment (a naive implementation of mergesort for an int[]) and the current ones.

Binary search: when the list is sorted, we can check the middle element and eliminate half the list,
leading to a search that only needs to check log(n) elements.

This, of course, can be done recursively; but (in my opinion) it's nicer when written iteratively.
