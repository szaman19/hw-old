If an array is already sorted, an easier way to located the desired item
is through DIVIDE AND CONQUER.

1. You would first divide the sorted list into two halves.
2. Check the first element of each half and if the item you are looking for
   is less than the first element of the second half of the list, simply 
   look through the first half only. If it is greater than the first element
   of the second half of the list, only look through the second half.
3. Keep splitting and checking the lists as described above until the item
   being sought is found.
