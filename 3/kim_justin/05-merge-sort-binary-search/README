You can search for a value in an unsorted list using a linear search: You can just loop through the array or ArrayList one item at a time until you either find the item or run out of elements.
If the array or ArrayList is sorted, you can search more efficiently. Come up with an algorithm to do so (and put a description of how you would do this in a README file in this homework folder.

Look at the (n/2)th element, x. If x is less than target, look at the (n/2)th element of n-naught to n-n/2. If x is greater than target, look at the (n/2)th element of n-n/2 to n-n.
