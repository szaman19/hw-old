    //first call: low = 0 high = the last index in the array
    /*1. if low >= high return where they meet - that will be the answer.
    2.Select a random pivot value p
    3. Reorder the array within indices low to high such that within that range,
       all the values less than p are to the left of p and all values greater than p
       are to the right. You might find this easier if you copy the elements into a
       new array then copy them back.
    4. Check to see the index of pivot. If itâ€™s our answer, return it.
    5. If not, adjust low and high and recursively call quickselect. */
