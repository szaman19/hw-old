Set 1:
1. Does the bug always move to a new location? Explain.
--The bug moves to a new location if the path in front of it is not blocked (by a wall or rock).
2. In which direction does the bug move?
--It moves one cell forward: straight in front of it.
3. What does the bug do if it doesn’t move?
--If its path is blocked, it turns 45˚ clockwise.
4. What does a bug leave behind when it moves?
--The bug leaves behind a flower when it moves off a cell.
5. What happens when the bug is at the edge of the grid? (Consider when the bug is facing the edge
as well as whether the bug is facing some other direction when answering this question.)
--If is facing the edge, it turns clockwise until it can move. If it is facing some other direction,
--it will move forward. The edge acts like a line of rocks.
6. What happens when a bug has a rock in the location immediately in front of it?
--It turns 45˚ to the right. The rock blocks its path.
7. Does a flower move?
--No.
8. What behavior does a flower have?
--It changes color depending on how recently the bug has crossed that cell.
9. Does a rock move or have any other behavior?
--No. It blocks the path of a bug.
10. Can more than one actor (bug, flower, rock) be in the same location in the grid at the same time?
--No. Only one actor can be on a location on the grid at a time.
	
Exercises:
1. Test the setDirection method with the following inputs and complete
the table, giving the compass direction each input represents.

Degrees	Compass Direction
0	      North
45	    North East
90    	East
135	    South East 
180	    South
225	    South West
270	    West
315	    North West
360	    North

2. Move a bug to a different location using the MoveTo method. In which directions can you move it?
How far can you move it? What happens if you try to move the bug outside the grid?
--You can move the bug in all directions. You can move the bug as far as the limits of the grid
--allow. If you try to move the bug outside of the grid, an error box will pop up and give details
--on the error that occurred. An IllegalArgumentException occurs, stating that the location is not valid.
3. Change the color of a bug, flower, and a rock. Which method did you use?
I used the setColor method.
4. Move a rock on top of a bug and then move the rock again. What happened to the bug?
The bug disappeared when the rock moved back. The same thing happens when moving a bug or rock onto a flower.
