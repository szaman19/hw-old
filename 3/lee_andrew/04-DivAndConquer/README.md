If the array or ArrayList is sorted, then you can reduce the search time by dividing the array into two halves. You check the middle index to see if it's less than, equal to, or greater than what you are searching for. If it's less than, you can just go down the array from the middle until you find the value. If it's greather than, you just go up the array from the middle until you find the value. And it it's equal to, then you just return that index.
