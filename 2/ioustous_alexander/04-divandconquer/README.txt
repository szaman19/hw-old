To find a specific value in an already sorted array, a method more efficient than linear serach might be to divide the array in half and look at the first element of the second half, and compare that to the value you are searching for. If the value should be before that element, continue the search with the first half of the original array, but if the value is greater than that element, continue in the second half. Repeat until the value is found, or until the size of both halves is 1 element, and if neither of those elements is the value you are searching for, then it doesn't exist in the array.
