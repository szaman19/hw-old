Searching Through a Sorted Array/ArrayList
There is an algorithm known as Binary Search. This algorithm works as follows:
1. Begin in the middle of the list. Your bounds are currently 0 and the end of the list.
2. Check the value at the current index (the middle). Check for the following:
    -If the index value is equal to your target, return the index.
    -If the index value is greater than your target, set the lowest bound to the current lowest bound
     and index-1 to your highest bound. Run it again with the same target but with these bounds.
    -If the index value is smaller than your target, set the lowest bound to index+1 and set the highest
     bound to the current highest bound. Run it again with the same target but with these bounds.

This works because in the first run-through, it begins in the middle (the average). If it's two high, then it searches through
the bottom half and runs it again while changing the bounds. If it's too low, it searches through the upper half and runs it again.
