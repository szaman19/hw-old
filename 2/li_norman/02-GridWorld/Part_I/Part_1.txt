2.	The moveTo() method operates by setting the Location of an Actor or one of its descendants to the specified Location. 
Thus, it can technically move in any direction, barring if its Location is at a boundary. 
If one attempts to set an Actor's or one of its descendants' Location to one outside of the boundaries of the Grid, the GridWorld program will issue an IllegalArgument Exception.
3.	In order to change the color of a Bug, Flower, and Rock (which are all descendants from the Actor class), their setColor() method must be invoked.
4.	When placing a Rock on the same location as a Bug. the Bug is replaced by the Rock. This is true for almost all of the descendants of the Actor class. 
However, a Bug cannot be replaced by a Flower. The Flower will be deconstructed.
