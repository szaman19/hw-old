You can use a binary search to split the ArrayList/array in half. First, you check to see if the middle value is greater or smaller than the value you are looking for. This allows you to ignore half the array. You keep doing this to narrow down the array by cutting it in half everytime until you reach your target. If your lower bound exceeds your upperbound, then your target is not in the array.
