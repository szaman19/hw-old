1.  The bug moves to a new location most of the time.
   It does not move when it is completely boxed in.
2.  It moves in its forward-facing direction when it
   can.
3.  If it does not move, it rotates in place.
4.  The bug leaves behind a trail of flowers.
5.  Should it face the wall, it turns clockwise until
   it canMove().
6.  The bug rotates clockwise until it is possible
   to move forward.
7.  Flowers do not move.
8.  Flowers begin being red but lose color as time 
    passes.
9.  Rocks display no behavior on their own.
10. Only one actor can be in any location.

5. First, you would have to declare and instantiate 
   a BoxBug. Then you must add it to the world,
   specifying the location and then tell the world
   to show() it. The end result would look like:
   BoxBug shein = new BoxBug(10);
   world.add(new Location(1,3), shein);
   world.show();
