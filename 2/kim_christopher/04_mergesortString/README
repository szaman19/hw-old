An algorithm that we've most likely all seen from the last term is binsearch. Using binsearch over linsearch is much 
more efficient in many instances. Binsearch basically works like this: 
1. Check the middle of the list and see if the object you're looking for is greater, less than, or equal to that object.
2. If it's not, then, depending on if it is greater than or less than, you will repeat these two steps again. 
The difference is that you will look at the lesser half of the list if the object is less than the middle object, 
and the upper half if it is greater.
