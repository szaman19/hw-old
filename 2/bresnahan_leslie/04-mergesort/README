Using a binary search you can find a value within an ArrayList much quicker.  You first check the middle value to see which half of the list you need to look at (if your value > or < the middle value) and then look at the middle value of that half and keep continuing until you find (or don't find) your value.  If your lower bound exceeds your upper bound, then you know your target is not in the array.
