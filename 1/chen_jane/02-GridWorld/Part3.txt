Grid World Part 3

Group Activity

1. Specify: Each group creates a class called Jumper. This actor can move forward two cells in each move. It ¡°jumps¡± over rocks and flowers. It does not leave anything behind it when it jumps.

a. What will a jumper do if the location in front of it is empty, but the location two cells in front contains a flower or a rock?
The jumper will turn.
b. What will a jumper do if the location two cells in front of the jumper is out of the grid?
The jumper will turn.
c. What will a jumper do if it is facing an edge of the grid?
The jumper will turn.
d. What will a jumper do if another actor (not a flower or a rock) is in the cell that is two cells in front of the jumper?
The jumper will turn.
e. What will a jumper do if it encounters another jumper in its path?
The jumper will turn.
f. Are there any other tests the jumper needs to make?
What will a jumper do if the location in front of it is occupied? 

2. Design: Groups address important design decisions to solve the problem:

a. Which class should Jumper extend?
The Jumper class should extend Actor.
b. Is there an existing class that is similar to the Jumper class?
The Bug class is similar to the Jumper class. 
c. Should there be a constructor? If yes, what parameters should be specified for the constructor?
There can be a constructor to set the color of the jumper.
d. Which methods should be overridden?
The act method should be overridden since it acts differently than an Actor.
e. What methods, if any, should be added?
canJump (boolean), jump (void), turn (void)
f. What is the plan for testing the class?
Place the jumper such that it faces the edge. Surround the jumper by flowers, rocks, and other Actors one tile away. Do the same two tiles away.
