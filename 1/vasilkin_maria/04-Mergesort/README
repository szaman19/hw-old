You could search through it with a binary search. Bascially, split the set into two parts and look in the middle.
Compare the middle value ot the value you're searching for. If the middle value is greater than your element, keep 
the first half. If the middle value is less than your element, keep the second half. Repeat. Divide. Conquer.
