Unfortunately, I was at a loss when it came to how to code the Knight's Tour, especially 
recursively. So, I sought online help and found www.wou.edu/~broegb/Cs345/KnightTour.pdf
and modeled a different Knight's Tour (KnightsRevised.java) off of that. While this 
definitely helped me better understand both this problem and how to use recursion in 
general, I could not successfully fix the problems I encountered here either.
