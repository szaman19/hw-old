The most efficient way would be a binary sort. Check the halfway point of the entire array, and see if your number is smaller or bigger, then start working on the appropriate half. Keep dividing in half and comparing until the target is found. That way, if there was an array of 100 elements, instead of doing a linear search and going through all 100 elements, you only need to check 2^n times. The binary search uses a O(logn) which is more efficient on larger sets than O(n).
