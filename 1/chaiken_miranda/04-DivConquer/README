	If you wanted to search more efficiently through a sorted array you could do it by using binary search. THis is a system in which you always checking the middle value first
	Let's say you're searching for x

	Find the middle index of the array
	if x > the value at the middle index
	     find the middle index in the top half of the array and search there

	else if x < the value at the middle index
	     find the middle index value in the bottom half of the array and search there

	else if x== value at middle index 
	     return index 

Repeat this with the selected half of the array. until the section through which you are searching is empty, in which case return -1.
